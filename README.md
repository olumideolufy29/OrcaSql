OrcaSql
=======
OrcaSql is a parser for Microsoft SQL Server data files. It allows you to read SQL Server data files without the use of SQL Server.

This solution is based on existing Mark's S. Rasmussen repository https://github.com/improvedk/OrcaMDF with the following enhancements:

 - modern data types support (Xml, HierarchyId, Geography, Geometry, DateTime2, DateTimeOffset);
 - improved formatting of the data shown in grid;
 - caching system tables only;
 - large databases support (tested on the Stack Overflow 2014 database https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/10/how-to-download-the-stack-overflow-database-via-bittorrent/);
 - schema added to names of the tables and data types;
 - fixed some bugs (like usage of pg_first - it works mainly for the sample DBs, but doesn't for real DBs, bug with multiple bit columns - https://github.com/improvedk/OrcaMDF/issues/32 etc.);
 - ability to generate an SQL script to fix corrupted page of database based on the page data from the file;
 - ability to export the data of the table from the backup to the SQL Server for further analysis;
 - columns with zero physical length (with default constraints);
 - skipping dropped column data;
 - skipping ghost ang ghost forwarded records;
 - external plugins support;
 - collation support;
 - SQL syntax highlighting;
 - similar to SSMS NULL value highlighting;
 - performance optimization.

You can also try OrcaSql with my SqlBackupReader.Demo plugin here: https://github.com/ycherkes/YCherkes.SqlBackupReader.Demo.
This demo version of the plugin supports uncompressed SQL Server backup files.
